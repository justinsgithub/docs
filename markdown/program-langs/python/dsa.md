# Data Structures & Algorithms

## stacks 

### understanding stacks

- a data structure in which all insertions and deletions are made at one end, called the top of the stack
- LIFO data structure: last in, first out
- common stack operations:
    - push(item): push item to top of the stack
    - pop(item): remove and return top item
    - peek(): return top item without removing it
    - is_empty(): return true if the stack is empty

- common stack applications:
    - reverse polish notation for evaluating arithmetic expressions
    - syntax parsing
    - cold stack: space for parameter and local variables is created
    - used in recursion
    - undo and redo operations in word processors
    - low-level assembly programming
