# Internet 

- the internet is not a strict set of rules, it is a design philosophy

## internet basics

### how the internet was born

- internet can be traced back to 1960's
- what we call the internet first started as a project for the United States government
- ARPANET = Advanced Research Projects Agency Network
- ARPANET was established in 1969 by the Department of Defense as a communication network 
- in order for the network to work, it needed to have a way for information to be sent reliably from one point of the network to another
- the blocks of information that are sent are called packets, and they need to be transmitted multiple times, simultaneously
- to do this a set of rules needed to be created
- in the 1970's, Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn created 2 sets of rules to do exactly that
- the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) TCP / IPas a communication network 
- in 1982 TCP / IP was introduced as the standard networking protocols on the ARPANET which remained under the control of the government through the 1980's
- in 1990 Tim Berners-Lee created an application called World Wide Web (later renamed Nexus), at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, or CERN
- using a NeXT computer Berners-Lee created the first web browser that allowed a user to navigate through pages of information using links to connect phrases to additional pages
- with this browser Berners-Lee alos created the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
- Berners-Lee also created the very first web server called httpd

### who manages the internet?

- nobody controls the internet
- a combination of government agencies, international groups, and companies in the private sector collaborate together to keep the fundamental technologies of the internet working 
- these groups form the rules that define how all of the different systems work
- the internet is formed of multiple networks that all conform to the standard protocols of the internet TCP/IP
- some of these networks are owned by private companies like your internet service provider, universities, cell phone companies and others
- all these different networks need to have a way to tell one from the other 
- it is like having a bunch of airports, each airport is run by a different group of people: 
    - you need to have a way to know that if you are going from airport A to airport C that the pilot knows where they are going
    - and that the airport you are going to knows to expect your arrival 
    - in the case of airports an agency known as the International Association or IATA developed a system of 3 letter codes that every airport throughout the world has adopted 
    - if you're at SFO and your bags and ticket have JFK on it, it knows that you are headed to New York City and every airport is aware of each other

- ICANN = Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers 
- URLS = Uniform Resource Locator
- the same happens on the internet, but instead of airports there are networks
- ICANN does the same thing, it manages the names or identifiers that are part of the internet like URLS
- URLs are the phrases you know for websites, portions of a website name (called a domain) are managed by ICANN

- for example: 
    - a government website in the US typically ends in .gov
    - commercial sites end in .com
    - international sites have their own designation
    - in the US it is google.com, but in Canada it is google.ca
    - Amazon in the UK is amazon.co.uk

- there are a few international agencies called standards bodies, like the W3C and WHATWG that are groups of people that work to develop a universally adopted set of rules(called standards) that software and hardware companies can rely on to build products that will work with the technology

- many of these standards bodies have individuals from private companies, and they work to add new features to languages and rules of the internet
- if a new company really wants to add a new feature to their browser but it is not part of the standard rules, they might add the feature in and tell their users and fans that this awesome new feature is available to them 
- if they like it they might demand that other browsers adopt it and then push for it to become a standard
    - on the other side, some companies might want to push their solution over another
    - so you have a situation where the makers of the browsers have alot of power in determining what goes into the rules, known as a specification(or spec)

## addressing & routing information

### sending and receiving information

### internet protocol & IP address

### scaling up the internet from IPv4 to IPv6

### Domain Name Server and DNS

### routers & redirecting requests

### packets & fault tolerance

### reliability and TCP

## web servers

### identifying a server with URLs

### HTTP and requests

### hypertext and HTML

### remembering requests with cookies 

### securing requests with SSL and TLS

## encryption

### Caesar's cypher and keys

### improving security with longer keys

### symmetric and asymmetric keys
