- take regular breaks
- there is actively thinking about something and then there is diffused thinking, where your mind thinks about things and processes them in the background
- you can actually problem-solve and be more creative when you are not actively thinking about something
- the 10,000-hour rule only works with targeted practice 
- when learning, have a clear, defined goal (deliberate practice)
- state you goal when starting a study session 
- "working on my problem-solving skills" is an okay goal but try to be more specific 
- "I am going to get better at really understanding what the problem is asking" is a better and more specific goal
- 100% focus, watching YouTube, a podcast, or trying to work on 2 things at once is bad focus
- go outside your comfort zone, work on things you're bad at
- identify a weakness, and attack it head on, practice it every day
- create a note with your weakness
- run through practice questions that target your weakness repeatedly
- head first JavaScript book is a good example of a good place to start
- building small projects is better to start with than 1 big too complex project
- tetris is an example of a too-big project, a to-do list and pomodoro timer are examples of better starting projects
- building many small projects helps you to understand all the complexity, context, and moving parts of large projects better
- learn the syntax of the specific language
