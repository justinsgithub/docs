# TypeScript Essentials 

- designed to be fully compatible with JS

- TS tooling is fully cross-platform

- TS is a superset of JS, which means it is an extension of JS, adding new features and syntax on top of the core language

### introducing TS 

- TS is a super set of the JS programming language that adds the concept of static typing to the core features of JS
- JS is and always has been a dynamically typed language
- both static and dynamic languages rely on types (definitions of data structures and behaviors to ensure their programs are correct)
- the different kinds of typed languages validate types in different ways 
- dynamic languages: 
    - aim to be much more forgiving at development time, relying on the concept of duck typing to validate that a particular object can be used a certain way 
    - duck typing refers to the idea that if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck
    - the net result of this approach is that tools do not have enough information to catch errors before the application runs

- statically typed languages: 
    - more rigid than dynamic 
    - aim to catch errors before the code is executed 
    - they do this by imposing restrictions on how you can interact with objects forcing you to clearly specify everything about the object that you are going to interact with 
    - in the static world you cannot just call a "quack" method on any object, you must first explicitly define a type that has that "quack" method as well as any parameters that need to be passed into that method, not to mention the value that the "quack" method will return to its callers
