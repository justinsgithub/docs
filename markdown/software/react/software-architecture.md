# Software Architecture

## basics

- what is software architecture? 
- the word architecture is normally applied to a building, referring to the overall structure and large scale design of that building, compared to interior design, which would be more of the details inside the building

- when talking software architecture, it is the study of the broader structure, organization, and patterns of a development project - primarily the ones that impact developer productivity overtime (the latter part is where normal architecture and software architecture may diverge a little bit)


### normal architecture

- design a building that fits constrained and required uses
- constraints include things like budget and zoning restrictions
- required uses is what the people using the building need it to do 
- once finished the build will remain static over time
- it may be renovated every once in a while and there will be ongoing maintenance with the plumbing and electrical, but for the most part we are not going to make any drastic changes to it

### software architecture

- design software that fits the constraints and required uses
- just like with regular architecture, the restraints can be things like budget 
- the required uses are what people are designing that software to do in the first place 
- will be constantly changing throughout its lifetime 
- you are never going to get to the point where everybody is happy with it and no one wants to add anymore features 
- managers and other stakeholders are always going to want to add other features 
- this means we have to design our software in a way that will be easily changed over time 

### software theory

- in theory software architecture is meant to be technology independent
- this means we design our programs without saying things like we have to use a certain database with it, or a certain front end framework with it 
- this allows for more flexibility incase you want to change your technologies down the road
