# Quick Notes

- put quick mental notes here to look on later so that work / study sessions are not interrupted

## general


- look into martext editor for editing markdown files
- look into bufferline bug deleting a file with buffer open and unsaved changes
- finish react essentials testing
- look at awk vi course
- avim? forked from lunar vim, create sh script to automate install process
- quick tip for forcing change 
- learn more about lua
- change misspellings.lua to autocorrect.lua
- add custom commit message to deploy.sh
- change learning-docs to docs
- add misspelling.lua to config page
- programming is for control freaks
- treat learning like starting a new video game, leveling up is fun and easy
- add LICENSE to public projects
- reformat portfolio to match public directory
- take learning regular expressions course
- look into vim repository for misspellings.nvim
- create tech-acronyms.md
- when you notice something you do not like about yourself or something you did, do not get down on yourself, make a mental note and tell yourself to get better at it

## command line
^ = ctrl
- ctrl a = move to beginning of line
- ctrl e = move to end of line
- ctrl left = move backward a word at a time
- ctrl right = move forward a word at a time
- ctrl u = delete from cursor to line start 
- ctrl k = delete from cursor to line end

## future project ideas

- tabber.py (a command line tool to automatically change tab formatting in a file)
- switch-nums.py (a command line tool to switch all spelled numbers to integers and vice-versa)
    - five would become 5, six-thousand 6000, etc and vice-versa

## neovim

- spc l f = format file
- use { } more 
- ctrl v c LETTERS TO INSERT j k = select visual block, correct selected columns, insert these characters, escape and make changes
- shift h toggles dotfiles
- learn better tab efficiency / knowledge
