# Camera Basics


## Primary Features

- shutter speed, ISO, aperture


### ISO 

- cameras / film / sensor sensitivity to light
- a measure of sensitivity to light
- set the ISO first and then set the shutter and aperture
- as the ISO setting is raised higher, the image appears to be brighter and the background becomes more "fuzzy"
- the background "fuzziness" is referred to as being noisy
- for best practices, you want to keep the ISO as low as possible, and then you use your shutter and aperture to give you a good exposure
- keeping the ISO low will give you nice, smooth, rich colors and low noise

### aperture 

- the measurement of how open or close the iris in the lens is 
- allows more or less light to come through 
- controls your depth of field 
- some lenses go as small as 1-2 inches depth of field as opposed to others which give you as wide of field as you could need, such as covering mountain ranges, valleys, etc 
- phone cameras come with a very wide depth of field
- aperture is controlled by an F-stop number
- F-stop is a measurement of the distance of the opening of the aperture to the inner edge of the diameter of the lens 
- the lower the F-stop number the more open it is 
- the more open it is / lower F-stop number is, the more shallow the depth of field
- a lower F-stop can put an object more in focus from the background 
- a higher F-stop puts an object more even with the background, which would not be ideal for something like a personal photo shoot in a downtown city
- lowering the F-stop can make a picture of a crowd become a picture of a single person 

### shutter speed 

- the slower the shutter speed, the more it allows light to be absorbed by the lens 
- a faster shutter speed is what you would use when it is bright and sunny outside and you do not want your image to be over exposed or blown out 
- when someone is shaking their head, a fast shutter speed will make their face appear as if they were not moving, a slow shutter speed will make it look like they were moving and look blurry
- 1 / 400 of a second is generally fast enough to stop human motion, if someone is running it would capture them mid stride and catch a clear image that make it look like they were posing 


### AV / TV / A / S

- aperture value / time value / aperture / shutter
- adjusts the settings for said values on the camera
- allows camera to automatically calculate aperture based on shutter speed or type of shot you are trying to get
