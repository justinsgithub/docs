# SEO Fundamentals

## overview of SEO 

### what is SEO?

- the process of making improvements on and off your website in order to gain more exposure in search engine results 
- more exposure in SEO will lead to more visitors finding you for the right reasons
- SEs try to find and understand all the content out there on the internet
    - quickly deliver relevant and authoritative results based on any phrase the user might be searching for 

- when user searches for California Hotels, SE wants to show list of results relevant to the topic of Cali hotels
- SE analyze all pages ever visited and pick out pages they believe are most relevant
- relevance is determined by things such as how your content is written and implemented in code, as well as how other websites around the internet are linking to you 
    - all of this is stuffed into a very complex and very proprietary index.
    - uses complex algorithms to rank and display all of those webpages in order of relevance to that phrase that the user just typed in, such as Cali Hotels

- SE makes clear distinctions between content that is for Cali Hotels and content that is for Cali Resorts
- SE understand quite a bit about semantic and thematic connections between words and concepts
- SE knows that the search dog crates is relevant to a site selling pet carriers
- SE also takes authority very seriously, is your website a trusted place that the Engine wants to show their users?
- one way SE determine how safe you are is evaluating how many websites link to you 
- this is measure by links and sentiment (product reviews and such)
- links are like a vote on the internet, links from more trusted sites are valued more
- fake links are very bad for SEO

### reading search engine results pages (SERP)

- paid listings are actual advertisements
- a typical SERP will have 10 organic results that link out to different webpages
    - sometimes referred to as the 10 blue links, each include at least a headline, description, and visible URL
    - also return things like videos and maps, we now have blended results
    

### setting SEO expectations

- SEO is a bit different from other marketing strategies
- patience is a virtue, especially with SEO
- approach SEO as a long term process that builds long term value
- there is a reason the "rank #1 in google scams" are called scams (they are scams)
- it takes time to:
    - develop and execute on your strategy
    - research your keywords and understand their intent
    - create valuable and useful content
    - attract relevant links and authority signals
    - resolve any technical issues with your site
    - never ending process, always work to be done

- SE algos frequently change and your SEO work needs to keep up with them


### how SEO affects your business

- intent = motivation behind a search 
- what people search for and the words they choose when making their query says a lot about their intent, or what actions they want to take at a specific moment in time
- one of the biggest benefits of SEO is the ability to actually measure your results
- you can use your website analytics data to find out exactly how successful you are in acquiring search engine users 
    - you can see if those users actions are inline with your business goals
    - you can evaluate the effectiveness of your content in attracting and advancing the user through your sales flow
    - you can measure what they do and do not do on your website and beyond
    - by attaching real dollars and cents to users actions that began with a simple search, you will be able to truly measure return on investment from your SEO channel


### why you need a keyword-research plan 

- before you optimize your website you need to know what your are optimizing for 
- keywords = search terms that people enter into search engines
- formal keyword research is the foundational piece in SEO, that will help you understand what people are typing in the search engines 

- keyword research:
    - the intent of those keywords 
    - frequency 
    - relevance to business objectives
    - how competitive the terms will be to try to rank for (car would be a highly competitive and not the best choice)
