# Python Recursion

## intro 

### concept

- how often is recursion used?:
    - in terms of day to day development the amount you use recursion will vary by context
    - some developers may make little or no explicit use of it 
    - for others it will be a mainstay
    - recursion is fundamental of the very fabric of computing

- common applications in modern computing: 
    - passing technical interviews for software development jobs
    - traversing hierarchical data structures, such as DOM tree, XML, file systems
    - many powerful algorithms use recursion, such as quicksort, depth-first search
    - data mining using web crawlers

### importance

- uses of recursion in modern computing:
    - used in compilers and linkers in the software build process
    - evaluation of arithmetic expressions
    - database design and information retrieval
    - most modern programming languages support recursion

- solving any non-trivial problem in computing involves finding ways to break complexity down into simple parts, recursion is excellent for this
